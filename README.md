## This is a SIMP module
This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP), a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP) and visit our [developer wiki](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/SIMP+Development+Home).

## tboot.pp
The tpm::tboot class is disabled by default. You will need to add "tpm::use_tboot: true" to your hieradata. When enabled it will look for the "has_tpm" fact and the version of Enterprise Linux. If it is version 6 or version 7 it will install the tboot RPM and setup grub for trusted boot. A reboot is required to enter tboot mode. If tboot was successful PCR 17-19 will be populated with real hash values. When tpm::use_tboot: is true and tpm::tboot::enable : is false, the module will uninstall the tboot RPM and reset grub to a non-tboot kernel.
